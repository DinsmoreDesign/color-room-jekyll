                <i class="fa fa-plus-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>(2) Lead shooters</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                You will receive 2 lead shooters all day! Steve normally goes with the girls and his wife Jane starts with the guys. Then we all meet up at the first look or ceremony location.

                <i class="fa fa-plus-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>10-12 hours of coverage</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Normally we try to start about a half hour before photo starts. This allows the photographer to have time with "the details" alone if they would like. We will communicate before hand with the couple and the photographer to see what the perfect schedule would be. Every wedding is different so we don't have a hard and fast contracted time in our quotes

              </p>
              <p>
                By shooting in higher resolutions we are able to not use intrusive lighting, while producing the most flattering motion pictures possible.

              <p>
                We use (2) static 4K cameras on tripods will be moved around depending on your venue and (1) <a href="http://www.red.com/products/epicw-8k" title="Learn more about the Red Epic-W" target="_blank">8K Red Epic-W</a> that we use to shoot your trailer footage. Everything we use is compact, so we can stay out of your way. We <strong>never</strong> use lights, to make sure everyone is comfortable in front of the camera. We do our best to never bring any attention to us and to stay out of the photographer's way by shooting with them. We <strong>never</strong> want to get in the way of guests or your photographers.

              <p>
                We use MediaZilla as it provides the easiest way to download, burn DVD/Blu Ray and view from your computer. Also included is a Vimeo Portfolio in 4K of your films, which is best for viewing on a phone or streaming via your smart TV, Apple TV or Roku. Here is an <a href="https://mediazilla.com/Iojvtr313" title="MediaZilla example delivery" target="_blank">example of MediaZilla's package</a> as well as a <a href="https://vimeopro.com/colorroomfilms/stefanie-and-frank" title="Example Vimeo Portfolio" target="_blank">Vimeo Portfolio</a>.

              </p>
              <p>
                Normally, we use 1 or 2 songs for your trailer (we purchase the publishing for the music that's used exclusively for your wedding), however, since we don't do cookie cutter trailers, this number may change in edit. Full films generally range from 1 to 2 hours depending on a variety of factors including ceremony length, first look, intros, ect.

                <i class="fa fa-plus-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>Drone coverage</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Yes we provide drone coverage! We fly them ourselves, only when it's safe for everyone, and do not outsource. Usually, we can find a window in the day, even if it's raining, to get it up in the sky. Things that will prevent drone coverage: high winds, rain, mist and available space to fly in.

              </p>
              <p>
                Our contract reads (90) days but normally our turnaround is <strong>much</strong> faster - usually, within a week or two, depending on a variety of factors. Since we shoot at very high resolutions, it can take a week for films to render (upload to sites, ect.).

            <div class="col s12">
              <p class="pink-text">
                <i class="fa fa-minus-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>Provide "Raw Footage"</strong>
              </p>
              <img src="{{ sit.baseurl }}/img/raw-footage.jpg" alt="Graded vs. Raw video footage" style="width:100%;height:auto;">
              <p>
                Since we shoot at very high resolutions in a "flat" profile there is no practical way to supply couples with the "raw footage". We also do not shoot our wedding films in a consumer format so the couple would need a commercial-level computer and software suite to view footage. However, we do communicate with all couples before hand, multiple times, to make sure if there is any event that is out-of-the-ordinary they want captured in full, we get it for them! The above image shows what raw footage looks like vs the finished product; the bottom half is how the footage looks, directly off the camera.

              </p>
              <p>
                We choose not to light any couple with anything except available light. We've found this makes the couple feel more comfortable, along with their guests. Static lighting also tends to <em>kill</em> the dance floor vibe!
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="col l3 m6 s12">
              <p class="pink-text">
                <i class="fa fa-minus-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>Fight with your photographer or vendors</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Your day is about the couple, not the vendors. We make sure to touch base with all vendors when possible before hand, especially the photographer. This way, we can coordinate and get a vibe for how they want to work.
              </p>

              </p>
              <p>
                We work with the photographer to make sure they get everything they need first, shooting around them. Usually, in the time they are taking to move flashes or change a lens, ect. we will shoot our footage. We <strong>love</strong> to get the couple out around sunset for a quick session when possible and will coordinate this with your photographer.

              </p>
              <p>
                We only include the best footage in your full length film and trailer. What this means is, normally, there isn't a lot of "getting ready" footage in our full-films, as it is reserved in small clips for the trailer. Again, every wedding is different and we will communicate directly with the couple before-hand to make sure we get all the coverage.
