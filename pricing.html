                            Normally we try to start about a half hour before photo starts. This allows the photographer

                            with the couple and the photographer to see what the perfect schedule would be. Every wedding
                            is different so we don't have a hard and fast contracted time in our quotes

                            this number may change in edit. Full films generally range from 1 to 2 hours depending on a
                            variety of factors including ceremony length, first look, intros, ect. Here is

                            do not outsource. Usually, we can find a window in the day, even if it's raining, to get it
                            up in the sky. Things that will prevent drone coverage: high winds, rain, mist and available

                <p class="subtitle is-4">
                    Since we shoot at very high resolutions in a "flat" profile there is no practical way to
                    supply couples with the "raw footage". We also do not shoot our wedding films in a consumer
                    format so the couple would need a commercial-level computer and software suite to view
                    footage. However, we do communicate with all couples before hand, multiple times, to make
                    sure if there is any event that is out-of-the-ordinary they want captured in full, we get
                    it for them! The below image shows what raw footage looks like vs the finished product; the
                    bottom half is how the footage looks, directly off the camera:

                            We choose not to light any couple with anything except available light. We've found this makes
                            the couple feel more comfortable, along with their guests. Static lighting also tends to kill

                            will shoot our footage. We <strong>love</strong> to get the couple out around sunset for a
                            quick session when possible and will coordinate this with your photographer.

                            in small clips for the trailer. Again, every wedding is different and we will communicate
                            directly with the couple before-hand to make sure we get all the coverage.
