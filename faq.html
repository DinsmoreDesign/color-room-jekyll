                What makes us different?
              </h3>
              <p class="subtitle is-4">
                Since every wedding is unique so is every video. We don't just slap a preset on your footage and call it
                a day. We bring your footage to life by color correcting and grading your footage to give the your wedding
                that classic Hollywood look.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="column is-4">
              <h3 class="title is-1">
                How much coverage is included?
              </h3>
              <p class="subtitle is-4">
                10 - 12 hours. Normally we try to start about a half hour before photo starts. We will communicate before-hand with the couple and the photographer to make sure the schedule works perfectly. Every wedding is different so we don't have a hard and fast contracted time in our quotes.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="column is-4">
              <h3 class="title is-1">
                Do you shoot any video with drones?
              </h3>
              <p class="subtitle is-4">
                Yes we provide drone coverage! We fly them ourselves, only when it's safe for everyone, and do not outsource. Usually, we can find a window in the day, even if it's raining, to get our drone up in the sky. Things that will prevent drone coverage: high winds, rain, mist and available space to fly in.

                When do I get my film?
              </h3>
              <p class="subtitle is-4">
                Normally we can have a full finished wedding trailer to you in about a month, sometimes less. If you have
                a deadline you want to meet please let us know ahead of time, we have never made a bride wait past a
                deadline for her film.
