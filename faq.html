                    <p class="flow-text">Since every wedding is unique so is every video. We don&#39;t just slap a preset on your footage and call it a day. We bring your footage to life by color correcting and grading your footage to give the your wedding that classic Hollywood look.</p>

                    <p class="flow-text">Normally we can have a full finished wedding trailer to you in about 1 month, sometimes less. If you have a deadline you want to meet please let us know ahead of time, we have never made a bride wait past a deadline for her film.</p>
