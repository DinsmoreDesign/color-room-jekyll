            Shooting wedding films can be complicated for the couple and the videographer. We try to take the stress and complications out by blending into to the background, normally working around the photographer. This helps us get the most honest and candid films possible.

            By employing traditional cinematography techniques with the latest technology we provide a state of the art film that also has a classic film feel. We avoid the "cookie cutter" style trailers and prefer to let every project stand on its own. If you have any specific requests please let us know ahead of time and we will try to accomodate you as much as possible!
