review: "My wedding hit a bump when another cinematographer up and backed out three months before the big day. I was pretty stressed about it when a friend recommended Steve and Color Room Films and since that day I was so happy! Steve was so incredibly responsive, faster than anyone I've spoken to! He was accommodating and really easy to work with! Steve, his wife and assistant were absolutely perfect on our wedding day, so kind, so fun and you barely knew they were there!!! The videos we received were so great and the turnaround was unreal! I've never seen work that fast! I highly recommend using them and would love to work with them again if ever needed!"
