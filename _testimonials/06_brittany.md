review: "The first few minutes on my phone consultation with Steve, I knew I had to book them. Our wedding trailer and full wedding video came out absolutely amazing. I also reached out to Steve to ask if there was any way he could help me make a video tribute to my mom, stepdad, and grandparents for the wedding and without hesitation, he said yes. There was not a dry eye in the house when the video came on at the wedding. They made the whole process leading up to the wedding super easy and everyone who has watched my wedding video, wedding trailer, and tribute video, has been absolutely blown away and are even using Color Room Films for their own weddings now. I honestly would look no further than Color Room because Steve and Jane are the best of the best and I promise you will be so happy with all they do and their work."
