review: "I found Color Room Films on “The Knot” and I am seriously so THANKFUL that I did. I picked up the phone, spoke with Steve and knew instantly he would be incredible to work with! I had spoken with a few other companies and no one was as attentive, polite, enthusiastic and as easy to speak with as Steve was. Please TRUST ME when I say that I had done extensive research and no other company seemed to have such a simple contract and price. Aside from Steve and Jane being the most reliable and responsive people; the traditional, heartfelt and beautiful ways they were able to capture our wedding is hard to put into words. The video is not just a video, in my opinion, it is a work of art. I have received SO many compliments after posting our trailer; our friends and family were BLOWN away. People have also told me it's the BEST wedding video they have EVER seen."
