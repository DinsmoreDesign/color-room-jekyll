review: "Color Room Films is simply put, THE BEST. My husband and I were hesitant to even book a videographer, as we weren't sure it was a necessary expense. BOY WAS I WRONG. Choosing Color Room Films to shoot our wedding was one of the best decisions we made in the entire wedding planning process. It wasn't until we came across one of their wedding trailers that were we convinced we needed a videographer - and it had to be them!"
