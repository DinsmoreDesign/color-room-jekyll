              <p class="flow-text">Steve and Jane considers themselves filmmakers, not just wedding videographers. Thier goal is is to tell your story through motion pictures. Before becoming a filmmaker, Steve was a professional musician and studio owner who traveled the country to record and play music. From New Jersey to California, and everywhere in between, he captured these stories through motion picture.</p>

              <p class="flow-text">After 10 years of recording and being on the road, Steve's passion for recording music had him, his soon to be wife, and dog, Meeka, getting ready for a move halfway across the country to work for the leading retailer and designer in customer recording studios. While working in the midwest, Steve received a formal training in videography, cinematography techniques and equipment that formed the technical basis for his style, all while he continued to film bands and events as a courtesy to friends.</p>

              <p class="flow-text">After half a decade in the midwest, Steve and Jane decided to start a family and head back to New Jersey (now with 3 dogs and first daughter, Carmella). After a bit of soul searching when returning, Steve took an opportunity to manage and create video content for a national music store.</p>

              <p class="flow-text">Through Jane's wedding photography business, their film work organically grew to what it is today. Because of this gradual maturation process, Steve and Jane have been able to hone their skills and really dig into what each bride wants. Thier deepest core value is to deliver a wedding film that is honest and far above any previous expectation by the couple. They are able to accomplish this by keeping their rates low, using Hollywood-grade equipment and never allowing themselves to be completely satisfied.</p>
