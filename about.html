            <strong>Our story</strong>
          </h3>
          <p class="subtitle is-4 is-spaced">
            Before becoming a filmmaker, Steve was a professional musician and studio owner who traveled the country
            to record and play music. From New Jersey to California, and everywhere in between, he captured these
            stories through motion picture.
          </p>
          <p class="subtitle is-4 is-spaced">
            After 10 years of recording and being on the road, Steve's passion for recording music had him, his soon
            to be wife and dog, Meeka, getting ready for a move halfway across the country to work for the leading
            retailer and designer in customer recording studios. While working in the midwest, Steve received a formal
            training in videography, cinematography techniques and equipment that formed the technical basis for his
            style, all while he continued to film bands and events as a courtesy to friends.
          </p>
          <p class="subtitle is-4 is-spaced">
            After half a decade in the midwest, Steve and Jane decided to start a family and head back to New Jersey
            (now with 3 dogs and first daughter, Carmella). After a bit of soul-searching when returning, Steve took
            an opportunity to manage and create video content for a national music store.
          </p>
          <p class="subtitle is-4">
            Through Jane's wedding photography business, their film work organically grew to what it is today. Because
            of this gradual maturation process, Steve and Jane have been able to hone their skills and really dig into
            what each couple wants. Our deepest core value is to deliver a wedding film that is honest and far above
            any previous expectation by the couple. We are able to accomplish this by keeping our rates low, using
            Hollywood-grade equipment and never allowing ourselves to be completely satisfied.
